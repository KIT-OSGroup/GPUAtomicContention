## Running

Execute `make` in the root directory to build, run, and evaluate the benchmarks for all configured GPUs.
Note, the evaluation scripts only generate the plots used in the paper
and require running all atomic contention benchmarks at least for `add_relaxed` operations on `device` scope.

Other useful commands include:

- `make run` to run build and run the benchmarks without evaluation.
- `make run-amd` or `make run-nvidia` to run only on AMD or NVIDIA GPUs, respectively.
- `make enter-amd` or `make enter-nvidia` to get a shell in the respective docker environment with all GPUs passed through for the respective vendor.
- `make plot` to evaluate without rerunning the benchmarks.

## Benchmarks and Tests

The benchmark suite includes the following programs:

- `bm_contention`, a benchmark evaluating atomic performance under contention and different memory access patterns.
- `bm_atomics`, a benchmark evaluating specific atomic stores and a spinlock implemented using either an _Atomic Or_ or an _Atomic Compare and Swap_ operation.
- `test_globaltimer`, a utility program to measure the rate of the globaltimer we use for measurement.
- `test_gpu_cpu_atomics`, a program to test PCIe atomics between the GPU and CPU.
- `test_cross_gpu_atomics`, a program to test PCIe atomics between two or more GPUs. This program uses a shared file for synchronization and the actual test.
- `test_barriers`, a program to test different grid layouts for maximum occupancy using a simple barrier implementation.

abstract = {GPU applications use atomic operations to coordinate data access in highly parallel code. However, relying on previous experiences and due to limited documentation, programmers resort to guidelines instead of concrete metrics to limit potential performance influences.In this paper, we introduce a GPU memory-subsystem microbenchmark suite for analyzing GPU atomic operations. Based on the benchmark results, we discuss two particular guidelines, namely: "use only one thread per warp to access an atomic" and "place two atomic variables on different cache lines to avoid contention." We demonstrate where these guidelines are effective and where actual hardware behavior diverges.},
